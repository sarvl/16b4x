ooe single core

internally change instruction format to be more core friendly 
decode into several uops
	mrd/wrm offset 

features
	pretty much everything from p16b3x

	configurable wide stages
	deep pipeline
		fetch - decode - allocate - execute - writeback

		depending on physical constraints

	internally decode short jumps into predication

	more advanced branch predictor
		use bigger tests!
	
	actually useful nonblocking cache
	prefetching

	buffers between FE/EX

	instruction merging and elimination
		mov Rd, Rs1
		op  Rd, Rs2
		=>
		op  Rd, Rs1,Rs2

		wrx UI, xAB
		op  Rd, xCD
		=>
		op  Rd, xABCD

		nop
		=>
		---

		cmp Ra, Rb
		jcs CCC dest
		=>
		bCCC Ra, Rb, dest

		mrd Rd, Rs
		add Rs, c
		=>
		mrdincrement Rd, Rs, c

		pop Rd
		xwr LR, Rd
		=>
		pop LR (and copy into Rd)

		xrd Rd, LR
		psh Rd
		=>
		psh LR (and copy into Rd)
